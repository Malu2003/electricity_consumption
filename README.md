🔎 How it Works
1️⃣ Data Collection
User profile, appliance data, tariff rates, and historical consumption are collected via the app.

2️⃣ Prediction Engine
Trained ML models forecast consumption and potential savings using:

Appliance power ratings

Occupancy patterns (derived from family member ages and working status)

Peak and non-peak hour utilization

3️⃣ Cost & Carbon Calculation
Calculates:

Total Bill Amount = Consumption × Per Unit Cost

Carbon Footprint = Consumption × Emission Factor

4️⃣ Recommendation Engine
Suggests appliances to reduce, sorted by power rating, to meet optimal savings while ensuring comfort.

5️⃣ Notifications
Personalized in-app reminders for better usage timing and efficiency.
